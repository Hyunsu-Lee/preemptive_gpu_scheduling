### Static analysis tool 
This tool is for finding out the occurring clobber Andi-dependency pattern in the OpenCL GPU kernel source. For developing this tool, we used ANTRL 4 open-source(https://www.antlr.org/) for static analysis. But, because opened programming language rules for ANTLR 4 do not support the OpenCL context, we modified rule context based on CPP 14 rule context. you can easily run a static analysis using our modified rule context and python code defined for searching clobber anti-dependency.
