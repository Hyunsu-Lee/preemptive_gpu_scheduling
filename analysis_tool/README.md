### Static analysis tool 
This tool is for finding out occuring clobber andi-dependency pattern in OepnCl GPU kernel source. For developing this tool, we used ANTRL 4 open-source(https://www.antlr.org/) for static analysis. But, becuase opened programming language rules for ANTLR 4 are not support OpenCL context, we modified rule context based on CPP 14 rule context. you can easly run static analysis using our modified rule context and python code defined for searching clobber anti-dependency.
